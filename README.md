Ans: It was observed from the analysis that the bottom 10 customers hardly made sales in the year conisdered, some made sales once, and others just twice. In order for the management of KMS to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers, the management need to encourage these customers by giving more discount that will encourage more sales and in return more income to the company. They also need to look at the  acceptance rate of their product by the customer at these regions, thereby gaining insight on what to do such as rebranding, advertisement, e.t.c.

##### Q11: If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.
Ans: Based on the analysis above and the fact that delivery truck is most economical but slowest, it shows that the company didn't spent her shipping cost appropriately becasue the total shipping cost for the High and medium piority shipping of 22665.42 + 20513.93 which is  equals to 43,179.35 doesn't correlate with the amount spend for shipping through Express Air which is the fastest which totalled 7,850.91. This equally means that the company gave more priority to shipping through truck which is slowest and which supposed to be economical,
but acccording to the analysis, it wasn't economical.
